//Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
//Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around 
//the name is displayed.Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
var personName2 = " \t\t\t ayaan \n\n";
console.log(personName2);
console.log(personName2.trim());
//let name5 = "\t\t ayaan \n\n";
//console.log(name5)
//console.log(name5.trim())
